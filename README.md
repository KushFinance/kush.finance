KUSH.FINANCE is a Defi governance token represented by kSEED (kush.SEED) that turns individual traders into a collective whale. 
kSEED holders can stake their kushSEED's and receive a secondary token known as kKUSH(kush.KUSH).
 
When a user claims their accumulated rewards, they will only receive 80% of the reward.
 The other 20% is sent to be stored by the kSEED address in order to be used as part of the PUMPING mechanism.
 
kSEED holders will be able to bid on a Uniswap token that they want to purchase with the funds in one, or a series of, large buy. The predictability will allow kSEED holders and followers to buy and exit tokens as holders vote to enter or exit a token.
 
As a publicly governed token, holders are encouraged to create their own contract extensions to continue to grow the kSEED ecosystem.
